# Automating-Parallel-Pipe-network
 Problem statement - For given discharge (Q), we need to determine the distribution of flow across the ‘n’ parallel pipes
 
 To run the code download the hydraulics_project.cpp file
 In the folder where you have downloaded open terminal and type "g++ hydraulics_project.cpp" (This will compile the code using g++ compiler)
 then to make an executable file type "./a.out"
 then give the input values with space in every value
 input values will start with no of pipes, total discharge, then diameter, length, and roughness values ( order important) of n  pipes in respective order.
 
 The output will give the discharge and the friction factor values in each pipe.
